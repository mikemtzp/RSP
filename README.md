Rock, Sccisors and Paper game Proyect!
In this proyect we are aiming to build a basic game "Rock, Scissors and Paper" in which the user inputs an option into a box when the page is loaded and then receives an output that will be the result of the game against the computer in a message. All of this is going to be workin, in a first stage, directly in the Console.
